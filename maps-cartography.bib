  abstract = {The 18th century was a period of rapid growth for London, reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the Industrial Revolution, and London's role at the centre of the evolving British Empire. By the end of the century nearly one million people lived in London, about one tenth of the population of Great Britain. By 1715, London's population reached an estimated 630,000 people, roughly equaling that of Europe's largest city until that time, Paris. Within a few years London itself was the largest city in Europe, reaching 750,000 people by 1760 and 1 million by the end of the century.},

  abstract = {This paper contends that systemic violence is fundamentally a classification problem. The interrogation of the production of racialized library subjects in relation to one another and in relation to political and social conditions may shed light on the intensely complex problems of racism in the United States today. I discuss the ways that sections of library classifications were constructed based on ideas about African Americans in relation to American social and political agendas. My claim is that the structures that were written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are deeply embedded in our libraries and have participated in the naturalization of certain racialized assumptions and associations. In the 21st century we continue to maintain, apply, and refine a flawed structure. My aim is to provide a window into how epistemic violence affects American consciousness about race by revealing some of the ways that our library classifications have been woven together by a group of men who cited and informed one another and ultimately, organized and universalized American history. These classifications are structured around assertions about timeless and fixed national values constructed out of progressive conceptualizations of the nation and its citizenry. A reliance on racial exclusion was necessary for this grand narrative, and scientific theories and classifications provided legitimacy and fuel for racist programs. One of key ways that exclusion was legitimated and supported was through the application of evolutionary theory and principles. Social engineering, white supremacy, and conquest were justified and propelled by beliefs in the evolutionary superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race. It is not by accident that these ideas became foundational to classificatory practice in libraries. In fact, Thomas Dousa has drawn attention to the intellectual climate in which late 19th century library classificationists worked - particularly, the theories and classifications of the sciences and nature as devised by Auguste Compte, Herbert Spencer, and Charles Darwin - and argues that these ideas and systems inspired the introduction of evolutionary principles into bibliographic classifications.[i] The present paper is in agreement with Dousa's claim and argues that such a conclusion carries critical implications for understanding libraries' classifications of race and ethnicity. Emphasis is placed is on the legacy of the classification of books about people of African descent as variously named and conceptualized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last section of the paper examines the classifications as performatives to examine some of the processes by which racism has become systemic on library shelves. [i] Thomas M.

He reappears in "The Mystery of Marie Rogêt" (1842) and "The Purloined Letter" (1844). Dupin is not a professional detective and his motivations for solving the mysteries change throughout the three stories. Using what Poe termed "ratiocination", Dupin combines his considerable intellect with creative imagination, even putting himself in the mind of the criminal. His talents are strong enough that he appears able to read the mind of his companion, the unnamed narrator of all three stories. Poe created the Dupin character before the word detective had been coined. The character laid the groundwork for fictional detectives to come, including Sherlock Holmes, and established most of the common elements of the detective fiction genre.},

  abstract = {The newly-discovered Evesham world map, a wall map that was almost certainly commissioned for Evesham Abbey in about 1390, was added to and amended some 20 years later, and was then reused by 1452. It derives from what was probably a standard world map copied for Ranulf Higden for his "Polychronicon". However, there is no evidence that the Evesham map was ever intended to illustrate any particular text. Within the traditional geographical and spiritual framework, the pre-occupation with the universal, ancient, and mythical-typical of earlier large world maps-has yielded primacy to the depiction of contemporary England and the territorial, dynastic, and commercial aspects of English patriotism. La mappemonde d'Evesham, carte murale découverte depuis peu, qui fut presque certainement réalisée pour l'Abbaye d'Evesham vers 1390, reçut des additions et des modifications environ 20 ans plus tard, et fut encore mise à jour vers 1452. Elle s'inspire d'un type de mappemonde dessiné pour le "Polichronicon" de Ranulf Higden. Cependant, il n'existe aucune preuve que la mappemonde d'Evesham fût destinée à accompagner quelque texte que ce fût. A l'intérieur du cadre géographique et religieux traditionnel, le souci habituel des plus anciennes grandes mappemondes vis-à-vis de l'universalité, de l'antiquité et des mythes a cédé la primauté à la description de l'Angleterre de l'époque, et aux conceptions territoriales, dynastiques et commerciales du patriotisme anglais. Die neuentdeckte Evesham-Weltkarte, eine Wandkarte die ziemlich sicher für die Evesham Abtei um 1390 in Auftrag gegeben worden war, wurde ungefähr zwanzig Jahre später mit Ergänzungen und Verbesserungen abgeliefert und blieb bis 1452 im Umlauf. Sie stammt von einer möglichen Standard-Weltkarte, die für die "Polichronicon" von Ranulf Higden kopiert worden war. Es besteht jedoch kein Beweis, daß die Evesham-Karte jemals bestimmt war um einen speziellen Text zu illustrieren. Innerhalb des traditionell geographischen und geistigen Rahmens, das Beschäftigtsein mit dem Universalen, dem Alten und Sagenhaften-charakteristisch für ältere große Weltkarten-gab Vorrang an der Abbildung des zeitgenössischen Englands und den territorialen, dynastischen und kommerziellen Aspekten des englischen Patriotismus.}

  abstract = {Abstract Traditional historical narratives centered on borderlands often cast the Americas as undefined and unclaimed territory through which Europeans and Indians move, trade, make treaties, and make war in lands neither can fully claim. Yet documentary records indicate that many Europeans recognized American Indian territoriality and the power—sovereignty—accrued by their control of bordered political space. Europeans had to negotiate, and were subject to, the rules and controls of Indian jurisdiction. In the heart of Spanish borderlands we can begin to conceptualize borders as defined by Indian peoples and nations, be they hunter-gatherers, sedentary agriculturalists, or nomadic raiders. Studying the ways that each created and maintained borders according to economy, trade, raiding, hunting, kinship, enmity, and alliance makes clear how Indian polities exercised power with unequivocal spatial dimensions across the landscapes of early America.

  abstract = {Nationalism, as a political discourse requiring a fundamental connection to a particular territory has constantly referred to maps as evidence of the eternal existence of the respective nation. In the case of modern Turkey, the national map has been a symptomatic signifier of a constant anxiety of territorial loss. Built around such anxiety, Turkish nationalism has been sensitive towards the borders defining national territory. This article analyzes the use of national maps as instruments for the cultural production of nationalism in Turkey throughout the last three decades. In the process, it is intended to differentiate between official maps produced under state authority and popular maps circulated in mass media. Throughout the 1980s, national maps included in school textbooks presented a country surrounded by hostile neighbors on all sides, in tune with the political climate of the Cold War. A crucial aspect of these official maps was the cartographic awareness they generated which, in the following decade, would become operational in the widespread use of the map as a nationalist sign. With the emergence of the Kurdish question in the 1990s, the national map became a key instrument in promoting nationalist sentiments with the invention of the flag-map logo as a favorite symbol. After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Kurdish issue was projected on to Northern Iraq, and a new mode of cartographic representation was invented. “Appropriated maps” produced through the digital retouching of random maps found on the Internet visualized irredentist desires enlarging the country’s territory especially into Northern Iraq and invoking the Ottoman past. These maps, which consciously distorted geographical information, turned to historical references to sustain their cartographic validity.},

  abstract = {The literature of the eighteenth century is suffused with crime, but handles it in a wholly different way from that of the nineteenth and twentieth. Looking back across those centuries, it is easy to trace this difference to the penal realities of the time: the absence of any reliable system of policing, or of the detection of criminals on any routine basis. Furthermore, there seems to have been little ideological belief that this could or indeed needed to be done effectively. What system there was was largely privatised: the 'prosecution' of theft was the responsibility of the injured party, who might offer a reward for information or hire an agent. This situation fed straight into the hands of gangsters such as the notorious Jonathan Wild, who arranged in turn for the robberies, the receipt of the reward for returning the goods and, when it suited him, the arrest of the supposed thieves - usually members of his own gang - in his self-proclaimed role of 'Thieftaker General'. Alternatively, the authorities relied on members of the public to detect crime as it happened and summon the watch - parochially-based and with few autonomous powers beyond responding to calls for arrest.},

  abstract = {This article offers a textual “deep map” of a series of experimental commutes undertaken in the west of Scotland in 2014. Recent developments in the field of transport studies have reconceived travel time as a far richer cultural experience than in previously utilitarian and economic approaches to the “problem” of commuting. Understanding their own commutes in these terms—as spaces of creativity, productivity and transformation—the authors trace the development of a performative “counterpractice” for their daily journeys between home and work. Deep mapping—as a form of “theory-informed story-telling”—is employed as a productive strategy to document this reimagination of ostensibly quotidian and functional travel. Importantly, this particular stage of the project is not presented as an end-point. Striving to develop an ongoing creative engagement with landscape, the authors continue this exploratory mobile research by connecting to other commuters’ journeys, and proposing a series of “strategies” for reimagining the daily commute; a list of prompts for future action within the routines and spaces of commuting. A range of alternative approaches to commuting are offered here to anyone who regularly travels to and from work to employ or develop as they wish, extending the mapping process to other routes and contexts.},

A deep map is a way to engage evidence within its spatio-temporal context and to provide a platform for a spatially-embedded argument. The essays in this book investigate deep mapping and the spatial narratives that stem from it. The authors come from a variety of disciplines: history, religious studies, geography and geographic information science, and computer science. Each applies the concepts of space, time, and place to problems central to an understanding of society and culture, employing deep maps to reveal the confluence of actions and evidence and to trace paths of intellectual exploration by making use of a new creative space that is visual, structurally open, multi-media, and multi-layered"--},

From storytelling to modern virtual reality (VR) devices, artists and inventors have tried to capture their audiences by making them feel present in an alternate reality. Presence is the felt sense of the virtual environment being real, and it is dependent on the vividity and interactivity of the simulation, as well as user characteristics. As expected, inducing a subjective sense of presence has become more reliable as technology advances. As the sense of presence improves, the technology steps forward toward the Ultimate Display, a conceptual device that is an essential copy of reality and allows the user to transcend their physical bodies. Oculus, Samsung, and Microsoft, among others, have brought mainstream attention to VR in 2016. Modern technology is able to induce presence more reliably than before, and the elements of the Ultimate Display appear to be near at hand.},

  abstract = {This paper contributes to the burgeoning critical literature on the history of cartography by tracking the links between maps, knowledge and power that stemmed from George Vancouver’s survey of the north-west coast of North America. Dispatched to the region by the British in 1791, Vancouver conducted an exhaustive cartographic survey and has been represented as the ‘true discoverer’ of the coast. It is argued here that he created a cartographic space (rather than simply discovered a pre-existing geography), and that his reconnaissance induced and supported a range of imperial and colonial practices. Vancouver’s work played a central role in the creation of a system of imperial inscription that primed the coast for colonial intervention. Attention is paid to the ways in which Vancouver’s project became (and remains) authoritative and influential in imperial and colonial terms: how it turned the coast into an arena of British imperial interest by occluding prior and alternative inscriptions on the land; how a variety of colonial images, projects and associations were derived from his work; and how we might now see his work in relation to the present.},

If finding funding challenges inventors, investors have the challenge of determining where, how, and with whom to invest. Just because an emerging technology profits some that does not mean that any investor will profit. Standing between entrepreneurs and investors are fraudulent and frothy—speculative, likely-to-fail—firms, a sign of a growing market, reflecting the enthusiasm of promoters and the reality of technological and market uncertainty. Such firms can harm an entire industry by creating distrust and doubt, discouraging investment, and forcing legitimate firms to expand more resources to secure funding. Will fraud and froth adversely affect 3D printing? This chapter offers a historical perspective on people eager to invest in the emerging technologies of independent telephony in the 1890s–1910s, radio in the 1900s, oil in the 1910s–20s, and penny stocks. Although fraud and froth were rife in relation to all these technologies, demand proved so great that the losses comprised only a small part of the market. Similarly, 3D printing will suffer from fraud and froth, but the overall harm should be minimal.},

This essay reviews these developments, paying special attention to Anglophone examples. The critique of cartography's claims to science and revisionist art historical scholarship are first discussed, followed by comments on the changing relations between geography and cartography and the impacts of new technology on map making and use as these have been democratised through virtual cartographies. Growing artistic interest in researching and documenting spatial and environmental questions that involve use of many of these mapping practices is set in its historical context and related to geography's changing academic practices. Au cours des trois dernières décennies, des tournants importants se sont produits tant dans la pratique cartographique que dans les théories qui la concernent, et qui ont transformé le rôle de la cartographie en géographie, alors même que la fabrication des cartes faisait l'objet d'études qui font ressortir les liens actuels existant entre la géographie culturelle et différentes pratiques artistiques. Le présent essai se penche sur ces développements en portant une attention particulière au cas anglophone. La critique de la prétention scientifique de la cartographique et l'approche historique révisionniste de l'art seront d'abord discutées, suivront des remarques sur les relations changeantes entre la géographie et la cartographie, ainsi que sur l'impact des nouvelles technologies sur la fabrication et l'usage des cartes comme on peut s'en rendre compte par la généralisation des cartographies virtuelles. La dimension artistique de la recherche et de la documentation sur les questions spatiales et environnementales qui ont recours à ces nouvelles cartographies, est replacée dans son contexte historique et est mise en relation avec les changements survenus récemment dans les pratiques géographiques.},

Significant market developments are considered, including companies from certain incumbent industries moving into the 3D printing space, while 3D printing firms which have been particularly active in consumer- or prosumer-oriented markets scale back their operations. These developments do not refute Socio-Legal Aspects of the 3D Printing Revolution’s main argument: that 3D printing in practice is not prevalent enough yet to be truly disruptive for law and society, despite its theoretical potential.},

FabLabs constitute an attempt to transpose the open source mode of production from the domain of software into the field of art and design. In doing so, however, they run the risk of encountering the same legal restrictions that have been applied to the information realm, where e.g. copyright law has been used to create artificial forms of scarcity. De Filippi and Troxler discuss ways in which the copyright regime has been countered in the information realm to turn this scarcity into abundance. They investigate how 3D printing could be used to generate artificial abundance rather than artificial scarcity, meaning that resources that are naturally scarce are made more abundant (or less scarce) by legal or technical means. They conclude that there are three main barriers to abundance in the physical realm: raw material scarcity, exclusivity of production tools and facilities, and improper access to knowledge and skills.},

Especially because of its open character––the idea that anyone can be a designer or producer––3D printing challenges traditional design practices. In this light De Mul discusses the rise of Open Design, which is characterized by the fact that it involves downloadable works, that design is distributed, and that it is possible to recombine modules to personalize designs and to 3D print them at home or in a specialized shop around the corner. In order to gain a deeper insight into both the chances and the pitfalls of open 3D design, De Mul sheds light on some of the fundamental characteristics of the digital domain, specifically on database ontology, the ABCD of computing. Next, he examines the implications of database ontology for the world of 3D design. He argues that in a world of Open Design the designer should change (redesign) his activities. The designer of the future has to become a database designer, a meta-designer, who does not design objects, but creates multidimensional design spaces in which unskilled users are able to design their objects in a user-friendly way.},

  abstract = {Digital forms of networked misogyny have received much attention of late, both in public and academic discussions of changing gender relations. However, less work has paid attention to how lad culture emerges online, or how the researcher experiences the affective fabrics therein. In this article, we explore our engagement with platforms hosted by the companies UniLad and The Lad Bible. We define our experience of this field as intimate because (a) we downloaded them onto our personal mobile devices and social media accounts and (b) of how they are experienced as proximal, “sticky” and deeply affective. We approach digital lad culture through a methodology of misrecognition, drawing on the work of Sarah Ahmed, Jessica Benjamin, and Nancy Fraser. We show how accounts of the researcher’s own experiences through a methodology of misrecognition are crucial, providing new ways of researching, and, in turn, new ways of challenging, the digital proliferation of misogyny and sexism.},

This article uses feminist standpoint theory to investigate the language used in Goodreads reviews to better understand how these reviewers articulate intimate reading experiences. A total of 692 reviews of seven bestselling fiction and nonfiction books are analyzed by two methods. The first, thematic content analysis, involves close reading of the reviews. The second, sentiment analysis, is an automated “distant reading” process. These methods prompt us, as researchers, to reflect on the way they foster or inhibit a sense of proximity to readers, even as they reveal predominant features of Goodreads reviews. Together, the methods reveal that 86.1% of Goodreads reviews describe a reading experience, and 68% specifically mention an emotional reaction to the book, with the emotion most intense in reviews of fiction. Reviews also create social connections by mentioning other readers, authors, characters, and people from the reviewer’s life. Through their emotional language and sociality, Goodreads reviews present distinctive, intimate reading practices, constituting a new cultural phenomenon, and a unique opportunity for investigation.},

This article will briefly review the current state-of-the-art in the field of Spatial History as well as discuss a number of emerging trends such as deep mapping, digital storytelling and data visualization, utilizing examples from a variety of applications. Moreover, archaeologists can benefit from the substantial investments by the academy in the Digital Humanities, particularly in the United States and Canada. In sum, the article proposes that the scope of archaeological applications of geospatial technologies would be productively broadened through an increased engagement with the Digital Humanities.},

  abstract = {John Mitchell's famous map of North America stands as an archetype of the official publication of maps in eighteenth‐century Britain. It was, however, the product of a special effort by the Earl of Halifax, president of the Board of Trade, who sought to advance his own aggressive agenda with respect to the British empire in North America in the run‐up to the Seven Years' War (1756–1763, known in North America as the French and Indian War, 1755–1760), to persuade his ministerial colleagues both directly through negotiation and indirectly by manipulating public opinion. This re‐evaluation of Mitchell's work concludes that its archetypal status is unwarranted. The practices that were developed by administrators in London and the colonies for commissioning, using and circulating regional maps are examined. A distinction is made between the use by officials of printed maps as sources for general geographical knowledge and of manuscript maps for knowledge specific to certain administrative issues. Then the origins of Mitchell's map are re‐examined. The conclusion reached is that the map is truly innovative: it was the result of a uniquely successful solicitation of information from the colonies and its publication broke with the established patterns of map circulation and consumption.},

  abstract = {The Nobel Prize–winning author created the words for this unique play about religion in the twentieth century.The choruses in this pageant play represent a new verse experiment on Mr. Eliot’s part; and taken together make a sequence of verses about twice the length of “The Waste Land.”Mr. Eliot has written the words; the scenario and design of the play were provided by a collaborator, and the purpose was to provide a pageant of the Church of England for presentation on a particular occasion. The action turns upon the efforts and difficulties of a group of London masons in building a church. Incidentally, a number of historical scenes, illustrative of church-building, are introduced. The play, enthusiastically greeted, was first presented in England, at Sadler’s Wells; the production included much pageantry, mimetic action, and ballet, with music by Dr. Martin Shaw.Immediately after the production of this play in England, Francis Birrell wrote in The New Statesman: “The magnificent verse, the crashing Hebraic choruses which Mr. Eliot has written had best be studied in the book. The Rock is certainly one of the most interesting artistic experiments to be given in recent times.” The Times Literary Supplement also spoke with high praise: “The choruses exceed in length any of his previous poetry; and on the stage they prove the most vital part of the performance. They combine the sweep of psalmody with the exact employment of colloquial words. They are lightly written, as though whispered to the paper, yet are forcible to enunciate . . . . There is exhibited here a command of novel and musical dramatic speech which, considered alone, is an exceptional achievement.”},

  abstract = {Over two decades after the scholarly interventions that coalesced into ‘critical GIS’ as a field within GIScience, critical GIS remains underdeveloped in conversations on teaching and learning. The literature on GIScience education has emphasized content more than pedagogies – what to teach versus how to teach to move students toward particular learning objectives. This emphasis is reflected in dominant curricular approaches to critical GIS, in which questions around the complicated origins and complicit social, political, and economic relationships of GIS are taken up as discrete topics, tacked onto instruction that otherwise prioritizes technical dimensions of GIScience. We argue that GIScience coursework must resist such modularization by approaching critical GIS not as a set of topics, but an orientation to GIS praxis that ‘does’ GIS from within a questioning stance, to ask how we know. We outline specific curricular shifts and teaching practices we have used to foster this orientation in GIS students, offering ways of continually engaging students in practicing this orientation as they learn strong technical GIScience content. Finally, we trace the successes, challenges, and tensions sparked by these critical GIS pedagogies, drawing on student evaluation comments from our courses and reflecting on broader implications for GIScience instructors and geography faculty.},

  abstract = {During the mid-thirteenth century, Matthew Paris produced visual itineraries depicting the route from London to the Holy Land. These maps belong to an exegetical cartographic mode also found in other medieval maps, such as mappaemundi. Rather than serving as practical tools for directing pilgrims to the Holy Land, Matthew's itineraries served as occasions for spiritual pilgrimages carried out within the confines of St. Albans monastery. In contrast to the cartography that emerged during the early modern period, in which nature is conceived as positive and spatially continuous, these exegetical maps treat nature negatively as a space of discontinuity between sites of civilization. Through various cartographic strategies, nature is invoked only to be confined to the margins of medieval pilgrimage. Emptied of meaning, the natural world thus becomes a non-space that allows human interpretation to enter into the cartographic text.}

Drawing on literature from feminist and queer critical GIS, with special attention to the under-examined political economy of GIS, I suggest that the critical project of queering all of GIS, both GIScience and GISystems, requires not just recognition of the labour and lives of queers and research in geographies of sexualities. Based upon a queer feminist political economic critique and evidenced in my teaching critical GIS at two elite liberal arts colleges, I argue that the “status quo” between ESRI and geography as a field must be interrupted. Extending a critical GIS focus beyond data structures and data ethics, I argue that geographic researchers and instructors have a responsibility in queering our choice and production of software, algorithms, and code alike. I call this production and choice of democratic, accessible, and useful software by, for, and about the needs of its users, good enough software.},

Our previous work on ghettoization in Budapest and on the spatio-temporal patterns of Jewish persecution in Italy had a marked spatial dimension, both in the research questions we set out to answer and the methods we used, which were largely quantitative. During the course of our research, we progressively came to realize that a spatial perspective favors the voice of the perpetrator and that to fully comprehend and understand the geography of the Holocaust, we needed to engage with the voice of the victim, extend the set of methods and tools used, and broaden our epistemology. While proposing a fully-fledged model of a qualitative GIS of the places and spaces of the Holocaust is beyond the scope of this article, we: (a) argue for the integration of social network analysis, corpus linguistics, and spatio-temporal methods and for a mixed-methods analytical approach and (b) note how the topological and relational foundations we identify as fundamental to a GIS of place parallel the long-standing call for an “integrated history” of the Holocaust.},

Today it is possible to imagine a very different birth of GIS, based on globes rather than maps, and with positional uncertainty and spatial resolution addressed at the outset using hierarchical data structures for the globe.

We contend that building infrastructure is critical to keep pace with innovative pedagogies and scholarship. We offer theoretical avenues for libraries to build a repository 3D object files to be used in VR and AR tools and sketch some anticipated challenges. To build an infrastructure to support VR/AR collections, we have collaborated with College of Liberal Arts to pilot a program in which Libraries and CLA faculty work together to bring VR/AR into liberal arts curricula.},

  abstract = {Maps of the Encounter have been judged by the agenda of a positivist geographical history seeking to reconstruct the pathways, landing places, and settlements of European explorers and discoverers. They were studied largely for their practical use as tools of navigation, as aids to wayfinding on land, as plans for new colonial fortifications and towns, or as public propaganda images to attract new settlers to America. This paper argues that Native American mapping belongs in the cartographic record of the Encounter, and that European maps of the period can be viewed as statements of territorial appropriation, cultural reproduction, or as devices by which a Native American presence could be silenced. Recent studies in anthropology, art history, and ethnohistory identify a corpus of indigenous maps that represent valid “alternative’ cartographies, different from European maps, yet important in the history of spatial representation. In Mesoamerica, further decoding of cartographic elements in the pre-Conquest genealogical and historical manuscripts may well require revision of ideas about the cradles of cartographic innovation. Even in North America, where such artifacts are more fragmentary, there is a growing sense of the universal presence of mapping in a wide range of cultures. In Colonial America, Indian maps not only helped to guide the invaders, but Indian geographies were incorporated into the fabric of European maps that would become standard images of America for much of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. There also appears to be an ideological transformation in the indigenous use of maps as native peoples sought to resist Colonial power with the maps that were once part of their traditional culture.},

The design and construction of the application created a virtual diorama based on facts, using realistic 3D models and accurate perspective. Design affordances permit annotations with interactive and multimodal facts and stories, delivering interactive knowledge artifacts. The app combines real and virtual into one holistic and comprehensive learning experience, transferring scientific knowledge to the novice in an instant. The use of immersive augmented reality produced from accurate information, data visualizations, and bioacoustics creates context-sensitivity experiences inside the gallery and outside in the gardens. Distribution through the Apple and Google app stores to schools and homes can extend the broader impact of the educational mission of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and its biological research center, the Powdermill Nature Reserve.},

She argues that far from being on the periphery of developments in the early modern period, Qing China both participated in and helped shape the new emphasis on empirical scientific knowledge that was simultaneously transforming Europe—and its colonial empires—at the time.  Although mapping in China is almost as old as Chinese civilization itself, the Qing insistence on accurate, to-scale maps of their territory was a new response to the difficulties of administering a vast and growing empire. Likewise, direct observation became increasingly important to Qing ethnographic writings, such as the illustrated manuscripts known as "Miao albums" (from which twenty color paintings are reproduced in this book). These were intended to educate Qing officials about various non-Han peoples so that they could govern these groups more effectively.Hostetler's groundbreaking account will interest anyone studying the history of the early modern period and colonialism.},

  abstract = {Theory is not a goal in itself but a means of enriching the history of cartography by stimulating new research questions and objectives. In this paper the concept of 'transparent maps' (carriers of an image of the external reality of the world) and 'opaque maps' is introduced. The notion is approached structurally (standards of graphical representation, drawing, geometry, text); through the sociology of the map (map makers, institutions, the public); and through seeing maps in their cultural and historical context (an approach which raises issues of the definitional boundaries of the history of cartography and which is arguably one of the most stimulating perspectives today as fostered by, in particular, contributors to the "History of Cartography"). Finally, attention is drawn to three important topics for the research agenda: the links between maps and culture; maps as a language of communication and as instruments of power; and the links between perception, logic and mnemonics. / La théorie n'est pas une fin en soi, mais un instrument qui doit enrichir l'histoire de la cartographie, en suscitant de nouvelles questions et de nouveaux objets. La première étape, dans cette perspective, est un examen critique des choix méthodologiques qui déterminent souvent implicitement l'orientation de la recherche, et parfois ses limites: carte transparente et support d'un savoir extérieur, carte opaque se prêtant à une approche structurale (les niveaux de représentation graphique, le dessin, la géométrie, l'écriture, la figuration), sociologie de la carte (producteurs, institutions, public), cartes resituées dans leur contexte culturel et historique (mais se pose alors le problème des frontières de l'histoire de la cartographie). Cette dernière option constitute aujourd'hui l'une des perspectives les plus stimulantes, en particuler grâce au projet "The History of Cartography" publié par the University of Chicago Press. Trois grandes directions de recherches sont discutées: les liens entre cartes et culture; les cartes comme instrument de communication et de pouvoir social; la dimension cognitive des cartes, et en particulier les liens entre perception, opérations logiques et processus mnémotechnique. Loin de viser la construction d'un cadre général d'interprétation, la théorie doit enrichir l'approche quasi-anthropologique de corpus de cartes bien définis, précisément ancrés dans l'espace, le temps et le contexte culturel. / Theorie ist nicht ein Ziel für sich selbst, sondern ein Mittel für die Bereicherung der Geschichte der Kartographie durch die Stimulans neuer Forschungsfragen- und themen. Die Begriffe 'transparente Karten' (Träger eines Bildes der äußeren Wirklichtkeit der Welt) und 'undurchläßige Karten' wurden geprägt. Erstens: der Begriff wird strukturell erreicht (Standards der graphischen Darstellung, Zeichnung, Geometrie, Text); zweitens: durch die Soziologie der Karte (Kartenmacher, Einrichtungen, das Publikum); und drittens: durch Karten in ihrem kulturellen und historischen Zusammenhang (eine Vorgangsweise bei der Fragen bezüglich der genauen Grenzen der Geschichte der Kartographie aufkommen und die zurecht heutzutage eine der meist stimulierenden Perspektiven bildet und besonders durch die Mitarbeiter an der "History of Cartography" gepflegt wird). Schließlich wird die Aufmerksamkeit auf drei wichtige Themen für den Forschungsagenda gerichtet: die Verbindungen zwischen Karten und Kultur; Karten als Sprache der Verständigung und als Instrumente der Macht; und die Verbindungen zwischen Wahrnehmung, Logik und Gedächtnis.}

But, as Walter Allen suggests, the emergence of the nineteenth-century short story is, precisely, a modern phenomenon.  By the same token, the appearance of a new and modern kind of protagonist from the mid-nineteenth century, who has come to be called 'the detective', marks a distinction from earlier mysteries. In both cases, Edgar Allan Poe plays a crucial innovative role. While the form initiated by Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Twice-Told Tales (1837) and Poe’s Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque (1840) flourished in America, the short story failed to make as great an impression in Britain until the end of the century, held back by the success of the three-decker or serialised novel. However, when it did take off, this was in no small part due to the success of Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective stories in George Newnes’s Strand Magazine (founded in 1891).},

This chapter explores how the possibility of creating artefacts through 3D printing might change the way we relate to (3D-printed) artefacts. Keymolen argues that 3D printing might enable a new form of technological engagement. 3D desktop printers, she claims, can be considered ‘focal things’, artefacts that invite users to actively interact with them in such a way that the togetherness and interdependency with the object itself and the world it mediates become evident. She provides an analyses on three levels to support this claim. First, 3D desktop printers themselves, as artefacts, invite users to engage in the design process. The printer needs to be ‘played’ with in order to perform properly. Second, it seems feasible that the artefacts produced by a 3D desktop printer will be looked after more carefully than anonymous mass-produced objects, because they are personalized and self-made. And third, it even seems feasible that end users will build more sustainable relationships with mass-produced artefacts, because they can print spare parts for them when they break down, and thus fix them rather than replace them.},

  abstract = {Neither big data, nor data justice are particularly new. Data collection, in the form of land surveys and mapping, was key to successive projects of European imperialist and then capitalist extraction of natural resources. Geo-spatial instruments have been used since the fifteenth century to highlight potential sites of mineral, oil, and gas extraction, and inscribe European economic, cultural and political control across indigenous territories. Although indigenous groups consistently challenged maintained their territorial sovereignty, and resisted corporate and state surveillance practices, they were largely unable to withstand the combined onslaught of surveyors, armed personnel, missionaries and government bureaucrats. This article examines the use of counter-mapping by indigenous nations in Canada, one of the globe’s hubs of extractivism, as part of the exercise of indigenous territorial sovereignty. After a brief review of the colonial period, I then compare the use of counter-mapping during two cycles of indigenous mobilization. During the 1970s, counter-mapping projects were part of a larger repertoire of negotiations with the state over land claims, and served to re-inscribe first nation’s long-standing history of economic, social and cultural relations in their territories, and contribute to new collective imaginaries and identities. In the current cycle of contests over extractivism and indigenous sovereignty, the use, scope and geographic scale of counter-mapping has shifted; maps are used as part of larger trans-media campaigns of Indigenous sovereignty. During both cycles, counter-mapping as data justice required fusion within larger projects of redistributive, transformative and restorative justice.},

On the contrary, a quite different and much more evenly balanced process of negotiation and interplay between local and central authority facilitated the construction of an extensive, intrusive state. The maps, together with the legal documents that accompany them, also demonstrate that the Romanov regime-often considered the highest expression of early modern absolutism-frequently found itself entangled in its own laws and regulations.

  abstract = {The golden age of crime fiction is usually taken as the period between the two world wars, though some start it earlier, with the publication of E. C. Bentley's Trent's Last Case in 1913, and the first critic to use the term dated it from 1918 to 1930, followed by 'the Moderns'; major texts in 'golden age' style were also produced after 1940, both by new writers and by figures from the earlier period. The term 'golden age' has been criticised as being unduly homogenous and seen as inappropriately 'replete with romantic associations': in fact the types of crime fiction produced in this period were far from uniform - the psychothriller and the procedural began, there was a wide range of practice in the mystery and the stories do regularly represent types of social and personal unease which would contradict a notion of an idyllic 'golden' period. However, while recognising variety in the period, as well as the relative uncertainty of its borders, it is still possible to identify a coherent set of practices which were shared, to a greater or lesser extent, by most of the writers then at work. Elements that were randomly present in earlier crime fiction suddenly become a norm, like multiple suspects, and some earlier tendencies largely disappear, notably the use of coincidence and historical explanations. A genre of crime fiction, best named for its central mechanism as the clue-puzzle and epitomised by Agatha Christie and ‘S. S. Van Dine’, clearly forms a recognisable entity by the mid-1920s.},

The authors present examples of both GIS-based visualizations and inductive visualizations from their research on the geographies of the Holocaust, with a particular focus on using this method to identify and analyze spatiality in survivor testimony.

  abstract = {Few cases in the history of epidemiology and public health are more famous than John Snow's investigation of a neighborhood cholera outbreak in the St. James, Westminster, area of London in 1854. In this study Snow is assumed to have proven that cholera was water rather than airborne through a methodology that became, and to a great extent remains, central to the science and social science of disease studies. And yet, Snow's work did not satisfy most of his contemporaries who considered his proof of a solely waterborne cholera interesting but unconvincing. Uniquely, this paper asks whether the caution of Snow's contemporaries was reasonable, and secondly, whether Snow might have been more convincing within the science of the day. The answers significantly alter our understanding of this paradigmatic case. It does so in a manner offering insights both into the origins of nineteenth century disease analysis and more generally, the relation of mapping in the investigation of an outbreak of uncertain origin. The result has general relevance—pedagogically and practically—in epidemiology, medical geography, and public health.},

It is however older, more embedded in the scientific enterprise than the social critique, and in the end, more central to both than researchers typically recognize. This paper argues that medical mapping was from its start in the late 1600s principally a tool for the self-conscious testing of spatial propositions, arguing a relationship between health and place, and between the locus of specific disease incidence and suspected sites of local infectious generation. Through the nineteenth century the resulting work - social and medical - typically advanced a miasmatic theory that argued that infectious diseases were generated spontaneously and diffused naturally through the air. This paper reviews the history of medical cartography as a scientific enterprise in the age of miasma, and the importance of this work to social reformers as an outcome rather than a principal impetus to mapping as a critical tool.},

Intimacy is an enclosure over time, while cosmopolitanism is an opening through an event. These ideal forms become actual in digital media, which often reveal the dark side of intimacy, as they withhold the cosmopolitan event and hence the possibility of diverse yet cohesive collectives. I outline various fields of research where the contradiction between intimacy and cosmopolitanism can be explored and potentially resolved through methodologies that critically imagine alternative designs.},

  abstract = {Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit. The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel’s expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.},

The participatory visual methods used in this study, including map-making and digital tours of participant’s digital worlds along with visual elicitation interviews, are documented and explored in relation to Berlant’s work on intimacy and theories of networked affect.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT This article proposes the concept ‘platformed racism’ as a new form of racism derived from the culture of social media platforms ‒ their design, technical affordances, business models and policies ‒ and the specific cultures of use associated with them. Platformed racism has dual meanings: first, it evokes platforms as amplifiers and manufacturers of racist discourse and second, it describes the modes of platform governance that reproduce (but that can also address) social inequalities. The national and medium specificity of platformed racism requires nuanced investigation. As a first step, I examined platformed racism through a particular national race-based controversy, the booing of the Australian Football League Indigenous star Adam Goodes, as it was mediated by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Second, by using an issue mapping approach to social media analysis, I followed the different actors, themes and objects involved in this controversy to account for the medium specificity of platforms. Platformed racism unfolded in the Adam Goodes controversy as the entanglement between users’ practices to disguise and amplify racist humour and abuse, and the contribution of platforms’ features and algorithms in the circulation of overt and covert hate speech. In addition, the distributed nature of platforms’ editorial practices ‒ which involve their technical infrastructure, policies, moderators and users’ curation of content ‒ obscured the scope and type of this abuse. The paper shows that the concept of platformed racism challenges the discourse of neutrality that characterises social media platforms’ self-representations, and opens new theoretical terrain to engage with their material politics.},

However, we are still a long way from the promise of fabricating constructs approaching the complexity and function of native tissues. A major challenge is presented by the competing requirements of biomimicry and manufacturability. This opinion article discusses 3D printing in suspension baths as a novel strategy capable of disrupting the current bioprinting landscape. Suspension baths provide a semisolid medium to print into, voiding many of the inherent flaws of printing onto a flat surface in air. We review the state-of-the-art of this approach and extrapolate toward future possibilities that this technology might bring, including the fabrication of vascularized tissue constructs.},

  abstract = {In 1854, Dr. John Snow identified the Broad Street pump as the source of an intense cholera outbreak by plotting the location of cholera deaths on a dot-map. He had the pump handle removed and the outbreak ended…or so one version of the story goes. In medical geography, the story of Snow and the Broad Street cholera outbreak is a common example of the discipline in action. While authors in other health-related disciplines focus on Snow's “shoe-leather epidemiology”, his development of a water-borne theory of cholera transmission, and/or his pioneering role in anaesthesia, it is the dot-map that makes him a hero in medical geography. The story forms part of our disciplinary identity. Geographers have helped to shape the Snow narrative: the map has become part of the myth. Many of the published accounts of Snow are accompanied by versions of the map, but which map did Snow use? What happens to the meaning of our story when the determinative use of the map is challenged? In his book On the Mode of Communication of Cholera (2nd ed., John Churchill, London, 1855), Snow did not write that he used a map to identify the source of the outbreak. The map that accompanies his text shows cholera deaths in Golden Square (the subdistrict of London's Soho district where the outbreak occurred) from August 19 to September 30, a period much longer than the intense outbreak. What happens to the meaning of the myth when the causal connection between the pump's disengagement and the end of the outbreak is examined? Snow's data and text do not support this link but show that the number of cholera deaths was abating before the handle was removed. With the drama of the pump handle being questioned and the map, our artifact, occupying a more illustrative than central role, what is our sense of Snow?},

MR displays are defined by means of seven examples of existing display concepts in which real objects and virtual objects are juxtaposed. Essential factors which distinguish different Mixed Reality display systems from each other are presented, first by means of a table in which the nature of the underlying scene, how it is viewed, and the observer's reference to it are compared, and then by means of a three dimensional taxonomic framework, comprising: Extent of World Knowledge (EWK), Reproduction Fidelity (RF) and Extent of Presence Metaphor (EPM). A principal objective of the taxonomy is to clarify terminology issues and to provide a framework for classifying research across different disciplines.},

The introduction and spread of digital maps and mapping software, however, have added new wrinkles to the ever-evolving landscape of modern mapmaking. Fully updated for the digital age, this new edition of How to Lie with Maps examines the myriad ways that technology offers new opportunities for cartographic mischief, deception, and propaganda.

  abstract = {Exploratory studies have demonstrated the benefits of implementing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology in literary and cultural-historical research. These studies have done much to affirm the power and flexibility of GIS technology as a resource for humanities scholarship. At the same time, however, these studies share a common limitation in that they tend to rely on the analysis of point-based cartographic representations. Such representations are suitable for modelling quantitative geographical phenomena, but they are inadequate for modelling qualitative human phenomena. This inadequacy constitutes a significant problem for researchers who aspire to analyse the geographical experiences and spatial relationships represented in works of literature, including works that contain accounts of travel. The present article proposes a solution to this problem by demonstrating how advanced spatial analyses within GIS such as Cost-Surface Analysis (CSA) and Least-Cost-Path Analysis (LCP) can be used to facilitate more nuanced interpretations of historical works of travel writing and topographical literature. Specifically, the article explains how GIS, CSA and LCP can be combined to build coherent spatial models of the journeys recorded in the works of three canonical eighteenth-century British travellers, each of whom composed influential accounts of their travels through the English Lake District: the poet Thomas Gray (1716–1771), the naturalist Thomas Pennant (1726–1798) and the agriculturist Arthur Young (1741–1820).},

This article examines how researchers conceive online mourning in empirical studies and how such conceptions inform (or not) methodological and ethical decisions. Through a scoping review, we identified 40 empirical papers addressing online mourning. Our analysis shows that, while online mourning practices have overwhelmingly been problematized in terms of privacy and publicness within the current literature, ethical issues relating to their analysis have been scarcely addressed in empirical research. In line with Foucault’s work on the dispositif, we then examine the performative role of privacy and data sensitivity in the context of online mourning research (notably in relation to consent procurement) and discuss our findings in light of emerging trends in context-based ethics.},

  abstract = {The Newgate Calendar, subtitled The Malefactors' Bloody Register, was a popular work of improving literature in the 18th and 19th centuries. Originally a monthly bulletin of executions, produced by the Keeper of Newgate Prison in London, the Calendar's title was appropriated by other publishers, who put out biographical chapbooks about notorious criminals such as Sawney Bean, Dick Turpin, John Wilkes and Moll Cutpurse. Collected editions of these stories began to appear in the mid-18th century, and in 1774 a five-volume bound edition became the standard version. While many of its accounts are highly embellished and/or drawn uncritically from other sources, they are lively and full of incident, and often refer to contemporary events and social issues.  Along with the Bible and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, the Calendar was famously in the top three works most likely to be found in the average home. The entries editorialise strongly against their subjects, Catholicism, The Protectorate and Commonwealth, any political enemies of Britain (such as the French), drunkenness, prostitution ("Women of abandoned character"), gambling, "dissipation" in general and other "vices" generally while eulogising Protestantism, the Church of England, the English monarchy and legal system, the Common Law and Bloody Code, with some rare exceptions. One edition contained an introduction suggesting that swindling be made (another) capital offence. A new edition was published in 1824 by Andrew Knapp and William Baldwin, two lawyers, and a further edition in 1826, under the title, The New Newgate Calendar. A penny dreadful edition of The New Newgate Calendar appeared between 1863 and 1866. The name Newgate Calendar was also used as a term expressing all crime; ...I also felt that I had committed every crime in the Newgate Calendar. (Charles Dickens, Our Mutual Friend)},

This is evident in the documentary film Patience (After Sebald) by Grant Gee, which follows in the footsteps of W.G. Sebald and his walking tour of Suffolk, England, as described in his book The Rings of Saturn. A variety of strategies in cinematic cartography are used quite consciously in Gee’s exploration of space, place and story. Using Teresa Castro’s three cartographic shapes of cinema, I structure an analysis of the film’s opening scene through a discussion of cinematic cartography, or the plotting of geospatial data onto a map, as well as what I will differentiate as cartographic cinema, or the mapping of space through the cinematographic image. I argue that both are necessary not only to have a deep understanding of the world and our place in it, but also in how to transmit that knowledge to others.},

This work examines these maps from a historiographical as well as a historical perspective. It considers three main questions, namely how maps in the press should be conceptualized, how cartographic images in newspapers have been studied, and how these images changed over time. In order to provide a perspective on the origins, development, and impact of war maps in the press, this work will explore maps representing three geopolitical conflicts for Brazilian audiences: The War of the Triple Alliance (1864–1870), World War <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">II</span> (1939–1945) and the War on Drugs in Rio de Janeiro’s <em>favelas</em> (1994–2010). By exploring these war maps, specific cartographic practices used in this genre as well as the connections that this mode has with other types of map production and consumption will be identified.</p></section>},

  abstract = {Aim The purpose of this paper was to examine the possibility of using Augmented Reality to reduce memory-related ethnic bias towards places and to increase understanding of multicultural place meaning and change emotional attitudes towards historical sites. Background Theoretical and empirical works suggest that the direct, embodied contact with place's history facilitates understanding of its past. Places which were deprived of historical continuity are less liked and threatened by ethnic bias in collective memory. AR technology gives a possibility of recreating past of such places and in a consequence tests an influence of experience of place's history on psychological aspects of the people-place relationship. Method A between-subjects experiment was conducted, in which participants either walked with an AR application displaying historical photos in real environment or watched photos on computers. The chosen place was the former Jewish district in Warsaw, Poland. Results The results of multiple regression analyses showed that the AR application can facilitate positive attitudes towards a place, reduce ethnic bias and enhance multicultural place meaning. Conclusions We argue that AR could be used as a method of reviving (multi)cultural heritage, but also as a tool of reducing prejudices and increasing openness to other cultures and traditions.},

  abstract = {Mapping spatial information to represent indigenous knowledge (IK) and rights has been taking place since the early 1970s in various parts of Canada. These mapping initiatives continue to be primarily associated with traditional land-use (TLU) studies and have deep roots in participatory methods that include aspects of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). In the current context of encroaching industrial developments into indigenous homelands and the strengthening of Indigenous rights within Canadian Supreme Court rulings, the role of mapping TLU information is central. Who is conducting the research, what tools are used, and how this information is shared are all key questions being asked in the Indigenous context. As a result, the quality of spatial data has become a critical part of these engagement processes. This paper focuses on the intersections of new methods of TLU/IK data collection, namely a direct-to-digital approach that seeks to minimize misrepresentation and mistranslations of IK. From these intersections, the authors recognize the need to establish Indigenous-led quality indicators that directly address the introduction of new methods into the TLU/IK field. Indigenous geographic information and spatial data quality indicators will better address the current needs of Indigenous communities in the negotiation of resource developments in their territories, and provide a new path forward for enhancing the use of geospatial technologies in Indigenous communities.},

Forest mapping by government forestry planners allocates rights of resource use and land access according to forest types and economic objectives, only rarely recognizing indigenous occupancy rights or forest territories customarily claimed or managed by local people. As maps and official plans based on them ignore, and in some cases criminalize, traditional rights to forest, forest products, and forest land for temporary conversion to swidden agriculture, indigenous activists are using sketch maps to re-claim territories - a process that requires re-defining many traditional forest rights. The paper considers the political implications of mapping and the implications of a focus on land use rather than forest use.},

Geography relies on tangible scientific information while detective novels create mysteries around whodunnits, notably with Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes adventures. Detective Holmes reasons backwards, relying on his ‘theory of deduction’, a fictional method of using pertinent facts to unravel murder mysteries usually committed in dubious circumstances. Holmes’s method, however, stems from concrete geographical details. The purpose of looking at both ‘sciences’ in Doyle’s A Study in Scarlet is to facilitate the study of facts and fiction, from which emerges a juxtaposition in which character depiction and narration are dialectically intertwined. Reading together the art of fiction and the science of geography thus becomes a critical necessity. Looking at both indeed enables us to grasp more fully how character depiction and narrative structure operate in Doyle’s detective stories.},

  abstract = {Composed in early thirteenth-century Iberia, the Libro de Alexandre was Spain’s first vernacular version of the Romance of Alexander and the first poem in the corpus now known as the mester de clerecía. These learned works, written by clergy and connected with both school and court, were also tools for the articulation of sovereignty in an era of prolonged military and political expansion.In The Task of the Cleric, Simone Pinet considers the composition of the Libro de Alexandre in the context of cartography, political economy, and translation. Her discussion sheds light on how clerics perceived themselves and on the connections between literature and these other activities. Drawing on an extensive collection of early cartographic materials, much of it rarely considered in conjunction with the romance, Pinet offers an original and insightful view of the mester de clerecía and the changing role of knowledge and the clergy in thirteenth-century Iberia.},

From reconstructions of ancient building sites to platforms for overlaying maps that tell competing narratives, geohumanities has challenged many assumptions and limits of spatial technologies through the qualitative, historical, and interpretative methods of the humanities. Through processes of thick mapping and counter-mapping, the spatial turn in the digital humanities has also given rise to a broader scholarly reconceptualization of the significance of place in relationship to narrative, practices of representation, and digital technologies.},

  abstract = {Every year, a staggering five million visitors flock to the Grand Canyon to view its sweeping vistas. One of the most remarkable wonders of the natural world, the Grand Canyon has become a symbol of the American West—its Indian heritage, its pioneer spirit, its sublime beauty. It is one of the most photographed landmarks in America, and one of its earliest photographers was Henry G. Peabody. In 1879, Peabody, a member of both the Chicago Electrical Society and the Chicago Photographic Society, was the first to use electricity to project lantern slides, becoming a father of the modern slideshow. Recognizing an opportunity to promote migration and tourism, western railroads and postcard companies hired Peabody to document the natural beauty of the American frontier. Awed by its exotic landscape, Peabody turned his collection of photographs into an audio-visual slideshow that enabled thousands of people from Boston to Chicago and beyond to experience a mode of vicarious travel through electricity, sound, and photography. Peabody's original slideshow was possible only through advances in 19th-century technology, so it is a particularly fitting subject for this groundbreaking 21st-century digital-born, interactive scholarly publication. Originating from the Spatial History Project within the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford, Nicholas Bauch's Enchanting the Desert is a careful examination of Henry Peabody's early-twentieth-century slideshow of the Grand Canyon. By placing this study within the spatial framework of the Canyon itself, and embellishing Peabody's slideshow with rich overlays created through GIS mapping and virtual recreations of the canyon topography, Bauch has created a digital prototype for studying historical and cultural geography.   Enchanting the Desert also includes 80 essays on human geographical aspects of the Canyon, ranging from Native American habitation and names, through the physical hurdles overcome by Peabody as he created the slideshow, to the consequences of the image choices Peabody made on future access and tourism within the canyon. The result of deep archival research in the Huntington Library, employing the traditional tools of the historian and geographer, Bauch raises and answers questions only a born-digital project could make possible, and reveals a previously hidden geography of a landmark that has come to define the American West. <iframe width=350 height=210 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KIpZWxFB0E4 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe>},

The criminal along with the supernatural is one of the two main agencies of moral terror in literature.The Newgate novel and the sensation novel were sub-genres of the literature of crime, which enjoyed a relatively brief but quite extraordinary popular success in the 1830s and 1840s and the 1860s respectively. The Newgate novel was associated exclusively with male authors. The sensation novelists, on the other hand, included a number of best-selling female authors, and this fact made for important differences of emphasis in the two sub-genres, and also for significant differences in the critical response to them. Both generated debates whose terms extended beyond the literary, and which overlapped in interesting ways. Thus, as well as being entertaining and often absorbing narratives in their own right, these novels and the controversies they engendered tell us a great deal about cultural anxieties and social and literary change at two key points in the Victorian period. Newgate novels enjoyed enormous popularity and some notoriety in the early 1830s, and generated great debate and controversy in the late 1830s and the 1840s.},

Although ethical guidelines and recommendations have not reached a consensus on issues such as requiring consent for doing work on gray data in general, fruitful contextual discussions that take in differing worldviews and political goals can help triangulate an approach to making decisions for specific projects. Furthermore, the overt hostility of “alt-right” groups to researchers is also considered as a complicating factor, one that extends the meaning of “ethical responsibility” to also include responsibilities to additional parties, such as those you are citing, research assistants, and family members. The article concludes with a consideration of the intimate proximities created by social justice–oriented and digital methods research on the “alt-right,” and a set of guiding questions for doing such work that, while not quite a set of best practices, are offered as signposts to help researchers navigate what are ultimately highly singular and emergent ethical problematics.},

  abstract = {In 1851, the Great Exhibition in London’s Hyde Park featured displays of art and technology from across the world. Compared to exhibitions from France, India, and Great Britain itself, the U.S. section seemed unimpressive with the exception of one item: the Colt revolver. Following its appearance at the Great Exhibition, the Colt revolver emerged frequently in British popular culture and culminated in the appearance of cowboys with revolvers in the late 1880s on Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. This paper explores representations of masculinity, white imperial authority, and the American West in Victorian England by tracking the appearance of the Colt revolver in exhibitions, children’s literature, and staged shows. It follows three chronological stages of the Colt revolver: in exhibition culture, in popular literature, and in the Wild West Show. Ultimately, it demonstrates that while the Colt revolver failed in the British marketplace, it thrived in British popular imagination and established figures of the American West in the minds of many Victorians prior to the famed Wild West Show.},

  abstract = {3D printing was originally intended exclusively for industrial use. But it is progressively becoming a reality for consumers as well. While 3D printing empowers users, most of them require some sort of assistance in the creative process. For instance, at the moment, few consumers own a 3D printer, which means that most still need to use a third-party printer to bring their 3D designs to ‘physical life.’ Likewise, some consumers may own a printer but not have the skills and knowledge required to build the 3D digital model of the object to be printed. Finally, some consumers neither have the ability to create 3D models, nor the means to print them into physical objects. For these reasons, online 3D platforms have appeared in the past few years to fill in these gaps. Many of these cater to consumers and involve them as a part of the production process, either in the design stage or in the manufacturing stage. In this chapter, Rayna and Striukova provide an overview of the current online 3D printing platforms, and they investigate the topics of user-participation, co-creation, and crowdsourcing in relation to these online platforms, as well as their pricing and revenue models.},

Pennine Street was initially prompted by the London 2012 Olympic spectacle; more specifically, by the militarization of the Games through the proposed deployment of surface-to-air missiles at sites in London. The project initially took the form of three organized walks along the route of High Street 2012, from Aldgate to Stratford. Readings were made while walking on each occasion, and both photographic and textual collages emerged out of the initial walks. The project engages the idea of trespass as a political action, as both potent and futile, and traces the development of modes of photographic and textual “trespass”, or transgression. Textual collage is employed to investigate the possibility of articulating Pennine Street as a “space-between” the empirical and the imagined.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an introduction to the Humanities Special Issue on “Deep Mapping”. It sets out the rationale for the collection and explores the broad-ranging nature of perspectives and practices that fall within the “undisciplined” interdisciplinary domain of spatial humanities. Sketching a cross-current of ideas that have begun to coalesce around the concept of “deep mapping”, the paper argues that rather than attempting to outline a set of defining characteristics and “deep” cartographic features, a more instructive approach is to pay closer attention to the multivalent ways deep mapping is performatively put to work. Casting a critical and reflexive gaze over the developing discourse of deep mapping, it is argued that what deep mapping “is” cannot be reduced to the otherwise a-spatial and a-temporal fixity of the “deep map”. In this respect, as an undisciplined survey of this increasing expansive field of study and practice, the paper explores the ways in which deep mapping can engage broader discussion around questions of spatial anthropology.},

As highly intimate new media objects, placed next to our skin, they challenge our notions of privacy and contribute to the generation of affects—disrupting considerations of “successful” research. In this article, we offer an auto-ethnographic study of (not) using a wearable sleep-tracking device, the ŌURA smart ring, as a research device. We discuss the unexpected, intense affects we experienced when attempting to use the ring during a “failed” research process, feeling enchanted and harassed by it in turn. Reflecting on our affects enables us to identify different forms of intimacy: those related to disrupting the bodily norms of academia, and those disrupting the privacy of the sleeping body. To conclude, we discuss the potential of these disruptions to offer a better understanding of the significant role of the thing-power of research devices in qualitative research process.},

  abstract = {3D printing is a method of manufacturing in which materials, such as plastic or metal, are deposited onto one another in layers to produce a three dimensional object, such as a pair of eye glasses or other 3D objects. This process contrasts with traditional ink-based printers which produce a two dimensional object (ink on paper). To date, 3D printing has primarily been used in engineering to create engineering prototypes. However, recent advances in printing materials have now enabled 3D printers to make objects that are comparable with traditionally manufactured items. In contrast with conventional printers, 3D printing has the potential to enable mass customisation of goods on a large scale and has relevance in medicine including ophthalmology. 3D printing has already been proved viable in several medical applications including the manufacture of eyeglasses, custom prosthetic devices and dental implants. In this review, we discuss the potential for 3D printing to revolutionise manufacturing in the same way as the printing press revolutionised conventional printing. The applications and limitations of 3D printing are discussed; the production process is demonstrated by producing a set of eyeglass frames from 3D blueprints.},

French contributions to the development of crime fiction, in particular the detective story, are significant in the sense that one cannot conceive of the developments in nineteenth-century English detective fiction without them. Holmes's arrogance towards the continental police, notably the French, nevertheless bespeaks a certain amount of insecurity with regard to the fearsome reputation of the French police established during Fouchè's reign of terror under Napoleon, a reputation further consolidated throughout the nineteenth century.},

  abstract = {Maps have long played a crucial role in enabling people to conceptualize and navigate the world around them. However, maps also encode the world-views of their creators. Disputed international borders are one example of this: governments may mandate that cartographers produce maps that conform to their view of a territorial dispute. Today, online maps maintained by private corporations have become the norm. However, these new maps are still subject to old debates. Companies like Google and Bing resolve these disputes by localizing their maps to meet government requirements and user preferences, i.e., users in different locations are shown maps with different international boundaries. We argue that this non-transparent personalization of maps may exacerbate nationalistic disputes by promoting divergent views of geopolitical realities. To address this problem, we present MapWatch, our system for detecting and cataloging personalization of international borders in online maps. Our system continuously crawls all map tiles from Google and Bing maps, and leverages crowdworkers to identify border personalization. In this paper, we present the architecture of MapWatch, and analyze the instances of border personalization on Google and Bing, including one border change that MapWatch identified live, as Google was rolling out the update.},

  abstract = {The concept of “deep mapping”, as an approach to place, has been deployed as both a descriptor of a specific suite of creative works and as a set of aesthetic practices. While its definition has been amorphous and adaptive, a number of distinct, yet related, manifestations identify as, or have been identified by, the term. In recent times, it has garnered attention beyond literary discourse, particularly within the “spatial” turn of representation in the humanities and as a result of expanded platforms of data presentation. This paper takes a brief look at the practice of “deep mapping”, considering it as a consciously performative act and tracing a number of its various manifestations. It explores how deep mapping is a reflection of epistemological trends in ontological practices of connectivity and the “flattening” of knowledge systems. In particular those put forward by post structural and cultural theorists, such as Bruno Latour, Gilles Deleuze, and Felix Guattari, as well as by theorists who associate with speculative realism. The concept of deep mapping as an aesthetic, methodological, and ideological tool, enables an approach to place that democratizes knowledge by crossing temporal, spatial, and disciplinary boundaries.},

  abstract = {This article asks methodological questions about studying infrastructure with some of the tools and perspectives of ethnography. Infrastructure is both relational and ecological—it means different things to different groups and it is part of the balance of action, tools, and the built environment, inseparable from them. It also is frequently mundane to the point of boredom, involving things such as plugs, standards, and bureaucratic forms. Some of the difficulties of studying infrastructure are how to scale up from traditional ethnographic sites, how to manage large quantities of data such as those produced by transaction logs, and how to understand the interplay of online and offline behavior. Some of the tricks of the trade involved in meeting these challenges include studying the design of infrastructure, understanding the paradoxes of infrastructure as both transparent and opaque, including invisible work in the ecological analysis, and pinpointing the epistemological status of indictors.},

He had developed this method and, in particular, a new approach to organizing and indexing the entries, in the course of 25 years of personal note-taking and it proved quite influential. This paper presents the three major approaches to commonplacing as practiced by physicians and other scholars before Locke – the systematic or textbook approach, the alphabetical approach and the sequential or index-based approach – and it analyzes the ways in which Locke himself applied them in his own commonplace books. In comparison with established approaches, his new method offered a maximum degree of flexibility while facilitating the later retrieval of notes and minimising waste of space and paper. Thanks to these features, it was particularly well suited for physicians and natural philosophers who were interested in the infinite variety of natural particulars rather than in elegant quotes on a very limited set of classical topics. In conclusion, the potential epistemic impact of commonplacing on early modern medicine and natural philosophy is discussed, in particular its importance for contemporary debates about species and disease entities and for the emergence of the notion of "facts."},

Its immediate popularity is evidenced by an initial sale of nearly 300,000. Sales increased in the early months, before settling down to a circulation of almost 500,000 copies a month, which lasted well into the 1930s.  It was edited by Herbert Greenhough Smith from 1891 to 1930. The popularity of Sherlock Holmes became widespread after first appearing in the magazine in 1891. The magazine's original offices were on Burleigh Street off The Strand, London. It was revived in 1998 as a quarterly magazine.},

  abstract = {In 1921 the photographer, antiquarian and amateur archaeologist Alfred Watkins, delivered his newly formed thesis on the origins of ancient alignments in the west of England to the Woolhope Naturalists’ Field Club of Hereford. Watkins posited a correlation between ancient forts, moats, mounds, churches, trees and place names, which he had shown to produce straight lines running across the landscape. In 1922 Watkins published his first book on the subject, Early British Trackways, mixing amateur archaeology, social history and supposition to introduce what Watkins named “leylines” and setting out the guidelines for other would-be ley hunters. This paper explores Watkins’ ley hunting as a practice of “deep mapping”, examining its use as an applied spatial engagement with the hidden trajectories of the landscape. In addition to providing a concise cultural history of the leyline, with particular reference to the works of Alfred Watkins, this paper develops a critical engagement with ley-walking through an  auto-ethnographic response to a leyline that has been mapped and walked in Norfolk, England.},

To this end, they first track the emergence of three-dimensional printing technology. They draw the analogy with the developments of other digital technologies, particularly in media. In that way, they understand consumer 3D printing as the latest addition to these developments. Troxler and Van Woensel then sketch some of the next developments they expect in enterprise 3D printing. Framing 3D printing in the context of ‘industrial revolutions’ leads them to understand this development as part of broader, socio-technical ones that drive lateral power structures, distributed control and a networked society beyond the Internet in the physical realm. The authors then investigate some of the business and legal challenges for companies. Looking into these challenges leads them to matters of definition and scope in regard to product liability and consumer protection, and of intellectual property rights. Finally, the authors ask what governments can do to mollify concerns and let opportunities flourish. They provisionally conclude that an open-minded approach to 3D printing and the social-technical developments it represents is most promising.},

  abstract = {This article examines the role that place naming has played in the rescaling of the Pacific waters along the Canada/United States border as the “Salish Sea.” Drawing upon archival materials and a series of semi-structured interviews, we argue that the scalar framing of such waters as a delimited spatial “unit” was dependent upon the performative reiteration of citational practices that were employed over a period of two decades to discursively assemble these fluid multiplicities into a cartographically bounded space. Although one of the ostensible aims of this geographical designation was to acknowledge the longstanding presence of Coast Salish peoples in the region, the naming of the Salish Sea has also had the political effect of reinforcing neocolonial relations of socio-spatial dispossession by further entrenching the powers of the state as the final arbiter of geographical naming conventions. Décoloniser la carte ? Les enjeux politiques de la toponymie et le transfert d'échelle de la mer des Salish Cet article étudie le rôle que la dénomination de la « mer des Salish » le long de la frontière canado-américaine a joué dans le changement d'échelle des eaux du Pacifique. Des documents issus de fonds d'archives et une série d'entretiens semi-dirigés servent d'appui pour défendre l'idée selon laquelle la conception scalaire de ces eaux en tant qu'unité spatiale délimitée découlait de la réitération performative des pratiques citationnelles adoptées depuis deux décennies afin de traduire de manière discursive cette abondance aqueuse dans un espace cartographique circonscrit. Bien que l'un des objectifs apparents de cette appellation géographique fût de reconnaître l'ancienneté de l'établissement dans la région des peuples Salish de la côte, l'appellation de la mer des Salish a eu comme impact politique de renforcer les relations néocoloniales de la dépossession socio-spatiale en consolidant les pouvoirs étatiques comme arbitre final des conventions existantes en matière de toponymie.

  abstract = {Henry Tudor, who seized the English throne as Henry VII in 1485, and married Elizabeth of York, put an end to the Wars of the Roses. Henry VII was a resolute and efficient monarch who centralized political power in the crown. He commissioned the celebrated "Henry VII Chapel" at Westminster Abbey, and continued the royal practice of borrowing funds from the City of London for his wars against the French. He repaid loans on their due dates, which was something of an innovation. Generally, however, he took little interest in enhancing London. Nonetheless, the comparative stability of the Tudor kingdom had long-term effects on the city, which grew rapidly during the 16th century. The nobility found that power and wealth were now best won by competing for favor at court, rather than by warring amongst themselves in the provinces as they had so often done in the past.  The Tudor period is considered to have ended in 1603 with the death of Queen Elizabeth. Nonetheless, Tudor London was often tumultuous by modern standards. In 1497 the pretender Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be Richard, Duke of York, the younger brother of the boy monarch Edward V, encamped on Blackheath with his followers. At first, there was panic among the citizens, but the king organized the defense of the city, the rebels dispersed, and Warbeck was soon captured and hanged at Tyburn.},

In this chapter, Van Vugt analyses the online debates and the events leading up to the printable gun. He uses a broad and semi-structured tracing method to investigate in detail the different positions in the debate on 3D-printed weapons, and the various steps that led to the creation of the first 3D-printed gun. This method involves the use of a wide variety of new media sources, including blog posts, comments from forums and online communities, images, YouTube videos and so forth.},

In response, Islamabad pub­lished a map on 4 August 2020 showing all of Kashmir as part of Pakistan. At the end of September 2020, the Chinese government terminated the status quo with India in the Ladakh/Aksai Chin region. This indicates a new phase in the conflict over Kash­mir, in which China and Pakistan could work more closely together. In addition, the conflict is being expanded to include a new geopolitical dimension because, for China, the dispute with India is now also part of the struggle with the United States over the future distribution of power in the Indo-Pacific.

This paper examines the common ways 'decentralization' is used in blockchain discourse, arguing that it is generally used to suggest that the systems are resilient and lack concentrated power centers. The paper critically examines the claims of 'decentralization,' providing examples of actions by core developers and miners within crypto systems that undermine claims of decentralization. Finally, the paper's core contribution is to examine the consequences of uncritically applying the term 'decentralized' to blockchain systems and making legal judgments based on it. The paper argues that in suggesting that blockchain systems lack sites of centralized power, the term "decentralized" in effect functions as a liability shield for those operating the systems (developers and miners), creating what I call a "Veil of Decentralization" and giving a core benefit of organizational law to participants in these systems without accompanying obligations. Further, misunderstanding the power dynamics within blockchain systems can lead to faulty risk assessments, in that we may view the tokens of these systems as less malleable than they actually are. This errant risk assessment affects direct uses of the tokens as well as any financial products that use them as infrastructure, and may affect our understanding of them as commodities or money.},

Most writers have considered the heart shape a product only of mathematics, but some have recently offered other interpretations for the use of the heart. A classificatory system devised by d'Avezac in 1863, however, has impeded our understanding of the cordiform map, particularly in the matter of what is considered to be such a map. The nature of his classification and its reception by other writers since the late nineteenth century are examined in order to elucidate new directions for the study of the use of the heart shape in sixteenth-century cartography. /// Les cartes en forme de coeur (ou cordiformes) du XVIe siècle, comprenant celles d'Oronce Fine, Pierre Apian et Gérard Mercator, ont longtemps intrigué les historiens. La plupart des auteurs ont considéré la forme decoeur comme résultant uniquement des mathématiques, mais certains ont récemment proposé d'autres interprétations à cet usage du coeur. Cependant, un système de classification conçu par d'Avezac en 1863 a entravé notre comprehension des cartes cordiformes, en particulier quant à la manière dont une telle carte pouvait être considérée. La nature de cette classification et sa réception par d'autres auteurs depuis la fin du XIXe siècle sont analysées de manière à dégager de nouvelles orientations pour étudier l'usage de la forme du coeur dans la cartographie du XVIe siècle. /// Herzförmige Karten des 16. Jahrhunderts, darunter die von Oronce Fine, Peter Apian und Gerhard Mercator, beschäftigen Historiker seit langem. Die meisten Autoren betrachten die Herzform ausschließlich als Ergebnis mathematischer Überlegungen. In letzter Zeit wurden auch andere Interpretationen für die Verwendung des 'Herzens' geliefert. Ein Klassifikationssystem, das d'Avezac 1863 aufstellte, hat das Verständnis der herzförmigen Karte und insbesondere dessen, was eine solche Karte charakterisiert, behindert. Die Grundprinzipien seines Klassifikationssystems und ihre Rezeption durch andere Autoren ab dem späten 19. Jahrhundert werden mit dem Ziel untersucht, neue Forschungsansätze für die Verwendung der Herzform in der Kartographie des 16. Jahrhunderts herauszuarbeiten. /// Los mapas en forma de corazón (o cordiformes) del siglo XVI, incluyendo los de Oroncio Finé, Pedro Apiano y Gerard Mercator, han intrigado desde hace tiempo a los historiadores.

  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with mobile mapping practices in Sydney and Hong Kong. Since the development of mobile media technology, there has been widespread proliferation of geo-locative, quasi-cartographic mapping practices in which people use applications (apps) on their mobile phones to narrate and navigate their way through urban spaces. This has raised questions within scholarly communities about the impact that these new technologies are having on everyday practices and everyday lives. As such, this thesis seeks to contribute to a growing field of knowledge surrounding the transformation of wayfinding, navigational and spatial mapping in the wake of these developments. Focusing an empirical investigation in two post/colonial cities - Sydney and Hong Kong - it draws on ethnographic, archival and geographical data in order to situate mobile mapping in an everyday context.Building upon Foucault's work on order (2002b), knowledge (2002a) and discipline (1995), this thesis seeks to address the issue of power-knowledge relations within and without mobile mapping practices as political and generative contestations over the meaning of space, the potentiality of practice and the indeterminacy of the past. It does so by considering an over-arching discourse of cartographic reason, best articulated by Farinelli (1998) and Olsson (1998) as a rationalist, universalist and geometrical approach to spatial understanding. Moving beyond the Cartesian interpretation of cartographic reason, it argues that in an increasingly digitised and monadic world, analyses of cartographic discourse must expand into an investigation of the role of Leibnizian binary systems, universal characteristics and elasticity.As such, this thesis engages three heuristic lenses - space, technology and people - with which to understand the empirical material from different perspectives. It argues that digital mobile mapping practices can be understood as expanded and transformative descendants of the rationalist, universalist and scientific impulses that have characterised cartographic reason since the Enlightenment. However, where continuity can be traced across many different cartographic and mapping practices, as the power of cartographic reason continues to reassert authority and territorialise space and knowledge, equally, the contestations which where borne of initial and early colonial encounters continue to generate contestation, conflict and hauntings.},

Analyzing datasets that cover the entire world over long stretches of time, Andreas Wimmer focuses on changing configurations of power and legitimacy to answer these questions. The nationalist ideal of self-rule gradually diffused over the world and delegitimized empire after empire. Nationalists created nation-states wherever the power configuration favored them, often at the end of prolonged wars of secession. The elites of many of these new states were institutionally too weak for nation-building and favored their own ethnic communities. Ethnic rebels challenged such exclusionary power structures in violation of the principles of self-rule, and neighboring governments sometimes intervened into these struggles over the state. Waves of War demonstrates why nation-state formation and ethnic politics are crucial to understand the civil and international wars of the past 200 years.},

  abstract = {As narrowly understood among academic geographers and cartographers, critical cartography is a recent academic phenomenon. But criticism, more broadly defined and understood, has been part of mapmaking from its earliest days. Criticism is inherent in practice, in which even the most fundamental forms of field mapping involve the self-conscious resolution of conflicting reality claims. It is anticipated that the critical claims making of nonprofessional mapmakers will increase exponentially as the mapping technologies developed over the past century and a half by the professionals are increasingly embedded in accessible online mapping and mapmaking tools. It may not be anticipating too much to look forward to the day when mapmaking remakes itself into a completely critical practice.},

  abstract = {Maps are artifacts that selectively link places to other kinds of things for the purpose of underwriting the reproduction (or contestation) of the social relations of power, and therefore are more readily exemplified than defined. Maps have become important comparatively recently, almost all of them having been made in the past hundred years, and their growing use parallels the rise of the modern state. Although maps were made before the rise of the modern state, they were only rarely made, appearing sparsely in cultural records everywhere in the world, and generally as facets of small-scale cosmological speculation and large-scale property control functions (a military mapping function appears uniquely early in China, and a coastal sailing function in the late middle ages in the Mediterranean basin). Maps as a way of advancing propositions about an open variety of spatial relations, at any scale, begin appearing only in the fifteenth century (in the twelfth century in China), and do not become common until the sixteenth century, when map production explodes around the world, and indigenous traditions from Japan, China, Europe, the New World, and elsewhere fuse into the synthesis we recognize today. The map’s ability to embody the abstraction of the modern state is salient.},

AD 850 in Middle Saxon Lundenwic with sites dated c. AD 850 to c. AD 950 in Late Saxon Lundenburh. Differences in the archaeology of the two settlements are discussed.
