* Background/Scene Setting
- about 2/3 of the way through a third-year Digital History class
- students have learned *very* basic web dev skills, including
  - intro to HTML
  - basic CSS
  - extremely basic JavaScript fundamentals & DOM manipulation
- readings have included some classics in Digital History, as well as historiographical essays, most notably around Habermas's conception of the Public Sphere, as well as "objectivity" as an organizing principle in historical study.
- about to start a block on "Spatial History", which will take about 2 weeks
- in a typical online class I would monitor a Slack channel for communications - I tend to encourage interruptions in this class
* Today
- What is a map?
- Do maps tell the truth?
- How maps became *data* 
- A tiny GIS exercise
- (also, note re: assignments)
* This week's readings
 - Krygier, J., & Wood, Donald, "[[http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/utoronto/detail.action?docID=446595: ][Ce N'est Pas Le Monde]]", In M. Dodge, R. Kitchin, & C. Perkins (Eds.), /Rethinking Maps: New Frontiers in Cartographic Theory/ . (London, UK: Routledge, 2009).

* ACTION Wait: Indigenous Land Practices help us understand Geographical Information Systems?
#+begin_slideblock
- "ownership" is neither *self-evident* nor *universal*
- in indigenous land practices, *rights to land* were context-dependent and overlapping; hunting rights, farming rights, rights to the use of trees, rights to passage, had distinct referents
- map's like Alexander's (right) have been imposing European property systems on land for 400 years!
  - doctrine of discovery
  - racial theories
  - economic extraction
  - relations of dependence
- our GIS systems are not built to accommodate other systems!

* From Maps in General to Digital Maps
- maps make *arguments*
- maps /intrinsically/ "lie"
- maps *are linked to relations of power*
*Digital Maps*
- Digital Maps *write their assumptions into code*

- all data is "geo-tagged" (has location info = latitude-longitude co-ords)

  - "layering" a non-trivial taxonomic decision

#+end_slideblock

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
GIS is just a name for any system that tries to capture, manipulate, and represent geographical data. There are many GIS tools; the history department uses [[http://www.arcgis.com/features/][ArcGIS]], which is expensive and something of an industry standard, while many independent scholars use [[http://www.qgis.org/en/site/][QGIS]], which is free, open source, and not quite as powerful as Arc.

The data in a GIS is all [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging][geotagged]], that is, assigned a set of geographical co-ordinates. This sounds simple but it is actually quite complex, since any co-ordinate system is a /simplified projection/ of real, disordered, 3-dimensional space.  Many of the frustrations of working with GIS comes from the difficulty of rendering (say) historical map images /commensurate/ with modern, satellite-derived maps.

Within a GIS, information is generally accessed as a set of *layers*.  Data of specific types is /stratified/ in layers, in much the same way that one creates image layers in photoshop. This image gives a typical example.  Note that the creation of layers is itself an intellectual decision, relying on judgments about the relationships between individual bits of data.

- area overlays are generally *raster* images with *color value defined for every point* (some other layers will be *vector* images, e.g. lines & shapes, and sometimes marker icons)
- Most *baselayers* are rasters (though terrain images can be vectors)
  - baselayers are also almost always *tiled*. Why?

** Story of the HOLC and American Cities
- Housing becomes a concern of government *briefly* in 1918 but substantively only in 1933 w/ establishment of *Home Owners Loan Corporation* (HOLC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
*** HOLC: standardizing assessment
- granted many low-interest loans
- assessed properties on a national, standardized grid system A-D
- wrote into law a series of judgments that explicitly included racial characteristics of homeowners -- no A classification for e.g. Jewish or Negro neighbourhoods
- often characterized as d"contagion
- 
*** FHA: spreading prejudice
- not a lender, but a *guarntor* of loans
- much, much more widespread than HOLD
- required that *value* of home always larger than value of mortgage
- lower-grade neighbourhoods always of lower value, os loans harder to secure
- provided cover through the 1950's for many other practices by banks, covenants, etc.
- effects still felt today
