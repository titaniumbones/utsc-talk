To [settler] outsiders, it appeared that Mohawk land ownership was no different from standard individual free-hold tenure, except that Mohawks lacked a standardized system of land titles and *appeared not to respect others' property* [my emphasis]. But the Kahnawá:ke system of land ownership had its own logic and was in many respects similar to the practices in other Haudenosaunee... communities at the time. Kahnawakehró:non considered their entire territory to be owned collectively, but small pieces could be claimed by individuals as long as they were cultivated. Land left uncultivated became available to others. An individual could not claim more land than he or she could work. Standing trees could not be owned by individuals... (Rueck, . 132)

Another way to counter the colonialist effect of state-produced historical maps is to place them in context. Creating historical maps of Kahnawá:ke land practices using Walbank data and situating these maps in the context of Mohawk narratives of land and territory is a step in turning the Walbank Survey against itself. ... Reinterpreted and placed in historical and cultural context, it can take on new meanings. (Rueck, p.145)

- so first, we need to understand how GIS works
- all data is "geo-tagged" (has location info = latitude-longitude co-ords)
- layered data (like photoshop)
  - "layering" a non-trivial taxonomic decision
  - usually "baselayer" + "data layers" 
- managed by a database, often quite complex, sophisticated
#+end_slideblock

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
GIS is just a name for any system that tries to capture, manipulate, and represent geographical data. There are many GIS tools; the history department uses [[http://www.arcgis.com/features/][ArcGIS]], which is expensive and something of an industry standard, while many independent scholars use [[http://www.qgis.org/en/site/][QGIS]], which is free, open source, and not quite as powerful as Arc.

The data in a GIS is all [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging][geotagged]], that is, assigned a set of geographical co-ordinates. This sounds simple but it is actually quite complex, since any co-ordinate system is a /simplified projection/ of real, disordered, 3-dimensional space.  Many of the frustrations of working with GIS comes from the difficulty of rendering (say) historical map images /commensurate/ with modern, satellite-derived maps.

Within a GIS, information is generally accessed as a set of *layers*.  Data of specific types is /stratified/ in layers, in much the same way that one creates image layers in photoshop. This image gives a typical example.  Note that the creation of layers is itself an intellectual decision, relying on judgments about the relationships between individual bits of data.
