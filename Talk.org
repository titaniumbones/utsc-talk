- Every exportable entry must have the ~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~    [ State ]: EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or save it.
ffect until you set or save it.
ould write some code to shunt this stuff to ox-huveal instead of ox-hugo.  This is a project for another time.
- interestingly, I probably don't want to set ox-hugo-auto-export-on-save for this file, because my most urgent need is going to be to export local reveal files.  Exporting to hugo -- or huveal if I can figure that out -- will be difficult.
- so, maybe I want to repurpose some of the auto-export code for use with my lectures!

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
GIS is just a name for any system that tries to capture, manipulate, and represent geographical data. There are many GIS tools; the history department uses [[http://www.arcgis.com/features/][ArcGIS]], which is expensive and something of an industry standard, while many independent scholars use [[http://www.qgis.org/en/site/][QGIS]], which is free, open source, and not quite as powerful as Arc.

The data in a GIS is all [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging][geotagged]], that is, assigned a set of geographical co-ordinates. This sounds simple but it is actually quite complex, since any co-ordinate system is a /simplified projection/ of real, disordered, 3-dimensional space.  Many of the frustrations of working with GIS comes from the difficulty of rendering (say) historical map images /commensurate/ with modern, satellite-derived maps.

Within a GIS, information is generally accessed as a set of *layers*.  Data of specific types is /stratified/ in layers, in much the same way that one creates image layers in photoshop. This image gives a typical example.  Note that the creation of layers is itself an intellectual decision, relying on judgments about the relationships between individual bits of data.

**** Raster Images
- area overlays are generally *raster* images with *color value defined for every point* (some other layers will be *vector* images, e.g. lines & shapes, and sometimes marker icons)
- Most *baselayers* are rasters (though terrain images can be vectors)
  - baselayers are also almost always *tiled*. Why?

*** Georeferencing Basics
- Historical Maps are cool!
- Almost never perfect conformance to the default web projection (WGS 84, a modified Mercator!)
- They need to be *stretched and squeezed* to fit (like Procrustes)
- Georeferencing tools *match points* on two representations and *distort* the non-standard one till it fits.

* Week 8 (or 9): Deep Maps
** Lopez's Warning
#+begin_quote
I would like to tell you how to get there so that you may see all this for
yourself. But first a warning: you may already have come across a set of
detailed instructions, a map with every bush and stone clearly marked, the
meandering courses of dry rivers and other geographical features noted,
with dotted lines put down to represent the very faintest of trails. Perhaps
there were also warnings printed in tiny red letters along the margin,
about the lack of water, the strength of the wind and the swiftness of the
rattlesnakes. Your confidence in these finely etched maps is understand-
able, for at first glance they may seem excellent, the best a man is capable
of; but your confidence is misplaced. Throw them out. They are the wrong
sort of map. They are too thin. They are not the sort of map that can be
followed by a man who knows what he is doing. The coyote, even the crow,
would regard them with suspicion. (Barry Lopez, /Desert Notes/ 1975, p.85)

** Story of the HOLC and American Cities
- Housing becomes a concern of government *briefly* in 1918 but substantively only in 1933 w/ establishment of *Home Owners Loan Corporation* (HOLC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
*** HOLC: standardizing assessment
- granted many low-interest loans
- assessed properties on a national, standardized grid system A-D
- wrote into law a series of judgments that explicitly included racial characteristics of homeowners -- no A classification for e.g. Jewish or Negro neighbourhoods
- often characterized as d"contagion
- 
*** FHA: spreading prejudice
- not a lender, but a *guarntor* of loans
- much, much more widespread than HOLD
- required that *value* of home always larger than value of mortgage
- lower-grade neighbourhoods always of lower value, os loans harder to secure
- provided cover through the 1950's for many other practices by banks, covenants, etc.
- effects still felt today
